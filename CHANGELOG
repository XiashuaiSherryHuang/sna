CHANGELOG:

v0.3 - New Features, Changes, and Fixes
   General:
      All standard functions are now documented
      R package format is now supported
   New Functions:
      component.dist - Find the distribution of (maximal) component sizes within a graph
      components - Find the number of (maximal) components within a given graph
      eval.edgeperturbation - Evaluate a function on a given graph with and without a given edge, returning
      the difference between the results in each case.
      interval.graph - Construct one or more interval graphs (and exchangeability vectors) from a set of spells
      mutuality - Find the number of mutual (i.e., reciprocated) edges in a graph
      gscor - Computes the structural correlation between graphs
      gscov - Computes the structural covariance between graphs
      gtrans - Compute the transitivity of an input graph or graph stack.
      lab.optimize - Optimize a bivariate graph statistic over a set of labelings
      pstar - Fits a p* model using the logistic regression approximation 
      read.nos - Reads input files in Neo-OrgStat format
      rperm - Draw a random permutation vector with exchangability constraints
   Features and Modifications:
      diag.remove, upper.tri.remove, and lower.tri.remove now allow replacement with any value
      gplot now provides a slew of new parameters to change color, size, etc. of vertices, edges, and labels
      gscor and gscov now delegate to lab.optimize
      gscor, gscov, structdist now support exchange lists (via lab.optimize)

v0.2 - New Features and Some Bug Fixes
   New Functions:
      blockmodel - Generate blockmodels based on partitions of network positions
      blockmodel.expand - Generate a graph from a given blockmodel using particular expansion rules
      bonpow - Find the Bonacich power centrality scores of network positions
      equiv.clust - Find clusters of positions based on an equivalence relation
      evcent - Find the eigenvector centralities of network positions
      gdist.plotdiff - Plot differences in graph-level statistics against inter-graph distances
      gdist.plotstats - Plot statistics associated with graphs against (projected) inter-graph distances
      make.stochastic - Make a graph stack row, column, or row-column stochastic
      plot.blockmodel - Plotting for blockmodel objects
      plot.equiv.clust - Plotting for equivalence clustering objects
      prestige - Find actor prestige scores from one of several measures
      print.blockmodel - Printing for blockmodel objects
      print.summary.blockmodel - Printing for blockmodel summary objects
      sedist - Find distances between positions based on structural equivalence
      stackcount -Find the number of matrices in a graph stack (matrix or array data acceptable)
      summary.blockmodel - Detailed printing for blockmodel objects
   Features and Modifications:
      All centrality routines can now be rescaled (division by maximum realized value); default is always FALSE   
   Bug Fixes:
      Various centrality routines once again return values for the selected graph and vertices
